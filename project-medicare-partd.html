            <div class="content-block">
                <p>This analysis examines 2023 Medicare Part D prescribing patterns across <strong>359 medications</strong> in <strong>50 states plus Washington, D.C.</strong> The dataset represents approximately <strong>1.39 billion prescription claims</strong>. The findings reveal <strong>$2.68 billion in potential annual savings</strong> if generic adoption improved by just 25%. The largest single opportunity—<strong>$885 million</strong>—comes from three insulin products where brand-name versions are prescribed over 95% of the time despite FDA-approved alternatives. Generic adoption varies by only <strong>4.5 percentage points</strong> across states (74.4% to 78.8%), yet five states account for over <strong>$1.9 billion</strong> in potential savings. The primary barrier isn't medical necessity—it's systemic friction in how prescriptions are written and filled.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p class="lead-text">Working as a pharmacy clerk at an independent pharmacy in El Cajon, I see the same scenario play out every week: a Medicare patient hands me their prescription, I process it through their Part D plan, and their face falls when they see the copay.</p>

                <p>"Is there a cheaper version?" they ask. Sometimes there is—a generic that works exactly the same but costs a fraction of the price. Other times, their doctor specifically wrote for the brand name, and we're stuck.</p>

                <p>But here's what bothers me: even when generics are available, I see prescriptions come through for brand-name medications that could easily be swapped. An insulin prescription that costs $800 when a lower-cost alternative exists. An antipsychotic that runs $400 when the generic is $20. These aren't isolated cases—they're patterns.</p>

                <p>Insurance pricing often feels like a black box. This project analyzes Medicare Part D prescriber data from 2023 to quantify exactly how much money is being left on the table, and where the biggest opportunities for savings exist.</p>

                    <div class="method-icon">📊</div>
                    <h3>Data Source</h3>
                    <p>I used Medicare Part D Prescriber Data from 2023, published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The raw dataset is over 3GB and contains prescriber-level records with key information: <code>Gnrc_Name</code> (generic drug name), <code>Is_Brand</code> (whether it's brand or generic), <code>Prscrbr_State_Abrvtn</code> (state code), <code>Tot_Drug_Cst</code> (total cost), <code>Tot_Clms</code> (total claims), and <code>Tot_Benes</code> (total beneficiaries). After filtering to include only medications that have both brand and generic versions available, 359 drugs remained for analysis. The primary geographic comparisons focus on the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., with territory codes and military addresses retained separately.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="method-card">
                    <div class="method-icon">🧹</div>
                    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
                    <p>I organized the prescriber-level data in two ways: first by drug name and brand/generic status to create national medication profiles, and second by state and brand/generic status to build state-level cost comparisons. Where beneficiary counts were missing, I kept those gaps rather than filling them with estimates, since the claims and cost data were complete. Territory codes and military addresses were included but analyzed separately from the 50 states and D.C.</p>

                    <div class="method-icon">⚙️</div>
                    <h3>Savings Calculation</h3>
                    <p>For each medication, I calculated potential savings using this formula:<br><br>
                    <code>Savings = Brand Claims × (Brand Cost per Claim − Generic Cost per Claim)</code><br><br>
                    This shows the maximum recoverable cost if every brand prescription switched to the generic equivalent at today's generic prices. I chose the <strong>25% improvement scenario</strong> as the primary focus because it's ambitious but realistic—significant enough to matter without requiring that every single prescription be switched. For state-level savings, I measured how far each state falls below the national average generic adoption rate (<strong>76.4%</strong>) and calculated what they could save by closing that gap.</p>

                    <h3>Important Note on Insulin</h3>
                    <p>Most generic medications are chemically identical to their brand-name versions, which makes substitution straightforward. Insulin is more complex. Many "generic" insulin products are actually <strong>biosimilars</strong>—similar but not identical to the original. The FDA has approved these as safe and effective alternatives for most patients, but some doctors prefer brand-name insulin due to concerns about individual patient responses. The insulin savings figures in this analysis ($885M) assume these products can be safely substituted, which FDA guidance supports, but this may not apply universally to every patient.</p>

                    <h3>Your State Determines Your Generic Access</h3>
                    <p>Across the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., generic adoption rates range from roughly <strong>74.4% to 78.8%</strong>—only 4.5 percentage points. This narrow spread translates to hundreds of millions in unnecessary costs and suggests the problem isn't medical necessity but regional prescribing habits. When including territory and military location codes present in the CMS file, the range widens considerably (down to 69.7% and up to 100%), which highlights the importance of separating state-level comparisons from non-state codes.</p>

                    <h3>Systemic Friction, Not Clinical Necessity, Drives Brand Use</h3>
                    <p>Working behind the pharmacy counter, I see these barriers firsthand. When a prescription comes in for a brand-name drug and I know there's a generic alternative, I can't just make the switch—I need the prescriber's approval. So I call the doctor's office.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes I get immediate authorization. Sometimes the doctor specifically wants the brand version for clinical reasons. But often, the response is simply "that's what the doctor always writes," or the call doesn't get returned. The patient needs their medication today, so we fill the brand because that's what's written on the prescription.</p>

                    <p>This happens millions of times across the country. The $2.68 billion gap isn't driven by medical necessity—it's driven by workflow friction.</p>

                <h3>Limitations & Future Work</h3>
                <p><strong>Clinical equivalency assumption.</strong> This analysis assumes that every brand prescription could be switched to its generic equivalent without affecting patient outcomes. For small-molecule drugs, this is well-supported by FDA bioequivalence standards. For insulin and other biologics, the picture is more nuanced. Biosimilars are not chemically identical to reference products, and some patients may experience different responses. The insulin savings figures ($885M) should be understood as an upper bound that assumes full interchangeability.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What the data cannot tell us.</strong> The CMS dataset captures cost, claims volume, and geography, but not the reasons behind prescribing decisions. I cannot distinguish between brand prescriptions driven by clinical preference, insurance requirements, patient requests, or simply default prescribing habits. Prescriber-level data would be needed to separate these factors. Additionally, the dataset does not include patient outcome information, so I cannot directly validate that generic substitution maintains quality of care in practice.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Savings model assumptions.</strong> The 25% adoption improvement scenario assumes generic pricing remains stable as substitution volume increases. In practice, large-scale shifts in demand could affect generic pricing, potentially reducing per-claim savings. The model also assumes no additional friction costs (e.g., prior authorization delays, therapeutic monitoring) associated with switching. These factors would likely reduce, but not eliminate, the identified savings opportunity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Future directions.</strong> The most impactful extensions of this work would be: (1) tracking generic adoption trends year-over-year to identify whether market forces are already narrowing the gap; (2) analyzing prescriber-level patterns to identify specific high-brand-preference providers for targeted outreach; (3) integrating FDA biosimilar approval timelines to model how new generic entries may shift the opportunity landscape; and (4) incorporating socioeconomic and demographic factors that may correlate with both prescribing patterns and patient health outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
                    <p>I loaded 3GB of raw CMS prescriber records using pandas, filtered to the 359 drugs with both brand and generic versions, then organized the data at both the national (per-drug) and state levels.
